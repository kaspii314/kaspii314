## Welcome!

In case we haven't met yet, I'm Kate. I'm just a girl (elder millennial) who loves math and data. 

For as long as I can remember, I've had an insatiable curiosity to understand the world around me, to figure out the way things work and learn how everything is connected. In my younger years, this meant spending lunch in the school library, looking up my latest knowledge quest in the long row of dusty encyclopedias. When my third-grade teacher let us choose whichever topic we wanted for our first report, I picked the combustion engine because my nine-year-old self couldn’t wrap my mind around how the wheels of our box Toyota minivan magically turned all by themselves.

As time passed, this hunger for answers evolved into a passion for math and turning data into information. I studied mathematics for my undergraduate degree at Colorado Mesa University, working part-time for the head of the Department of Business. Over the summer, I worked in a cramped closet of a room with floor-to-ceiling shelves of binders, pages and pages of local economic data. My task was to catalog all this and turn it into something useful. I created my first database. The embers ignited.

I was fortunate enough to stumble into a career working with healthcare information and supporting payor systems. In the past decade, I've had the pleasure of tackling many rewarding problems, specializing in data engineering and warehousing, as well as advanced analytics. Recently, I obtained my Master’s of Science in Data Science from the University of Denver, and I am excited to be a part of the AI/ML transformation of our future.

## Sample Projects

### Anomaly Detection in Host Log Files

[Anomaly Detection in Host Log Files GitHub Repo](https://github.com/kaspii314/log_anomaly_detection)

In today’s digital age, cybersecurity has become a primary concern for business. While threats come in many forms, compromised credentials continue to be a main cause of costly breaches. It is essential that harmful user activity is identified and dealt with as quickly as possible, and this has become a fundamental capability of many cyber protection solutions. In this paper, we research whether we can identify anomalous user activity in massive computer (host) log files. Using Isolation Forest, we show that not only can we identify potentially compromised users, but we can do so with highly irregular and limited training data.

### Fetal Cardiotocograph (CTG) Classification

[Fetal Cardiotocograph (CTG) Classification GitHub Repo](https://github.com/kaspii314/fetal_ctg_classification)

Used during pregnancy to monitor fetal heart rate and uterine contractions, cardiotocography (CTG) tests allow early detection of fetal distress. Typically, CTGs are manually reviewed by obstetricians and midwives. One criticism of this diagnostic tool is the tendency for the same CTG to receive different interpretations depending on the reviewer (high inter-observer variability rate). An automated, reliable method for reading CTGs would empower expectant mothers with the knowledge they need while also reducing burden on their clinical teams.

The purpose of this research project is to leverage machine learning to interpret CTGs. We explore feature extraction methods and classification algorithms in pursuit of our research question: How do Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors compare in predicting normal vs. abnormal CTG results given test metrics?

### Network Traffic Botnet Classification

[Network Traffic Botnet Classification GitHub Repo](https://github.com/kaspii314/network_traffic_botnet_classification)

A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack may render a business’ digital services unusable, costing millions. Harmful network traffic must be identified and blocked as quickly as possible, without disrupting normal network traffic. This is a fundamental capability of many cyber protection solutions, and in this project, we utilize Random Forest to distinguish harmful botnet traffic from normal network traffic.
