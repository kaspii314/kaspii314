## Current Role
 
As a Senior Prinicpal Engineer, TLCP for Optum Technology, my core job responsibilities currently revolve around our new enterprise configuration management database (CMDB): I provide technical leadership over data architecture and data access solutions, as well as administer our infrastructure and workloads. I lead development for data ingestion, with sources ranging from event streams, APIs, and batch files to every flavor of database. Furthermore, I am accountable for the data strategy and technical execution of decommissioning our legacy CMDBs.
 
In addition to data wrangling and engineering, my duties include data science and analytic initiatives. I performed topic modeling (NLP) of IT incident and problem records to identify automation and self-healing opportunities for our infrastructure teams and graph analysis of network traffic for the implementation of micro-segmentation.
